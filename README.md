# MuninnDB

**Memory that strengthens with use, decays when ignored, and pushes to you when it matters — accessible over MCP, REST, gRPC, or SDK.**

## Try It — 30 Seconds

```bash
# 1. Install
curl -sSL https://muninndb.com/install.sh | sh

# 2. Start (first-run setup is automatic)
muninn start
```

```bash
# 3. Store a memory
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8475/api/engrams \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"concept":"payment incident","content":"We switched to idempotency keys after the double-charge incident in Q3"}'

# 4. Ask what is relevant RIGHT NOW
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8475/api/activate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"context":["debugging the payment retry logic"]}'
```

That Q3 incident surfaces. You never mentioned it. MuninnDB connected the concepts.

**Web UI:** `http://localhost:8476` · **Admin:** `root` / `password` (change after first login)

## Connect Your AI Tools

MuninnDB auto-detects and configures Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw, Windsurf, VS Code, and others:

```bash
muninn init
```

Follow the prompts. Done. Your AI tools now have persistent, cognitive memory.

**Manual MCP configuration** — if you prefer to configure by hand:

<details>
<summary>Claude Desktop</summary>

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninndb": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cursor</summary>

Add to your Cursor MCP settings (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninndb": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>OpenClaw</summary>

Add to your OpenClaw MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninndb": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windsurf / VS Code</summary>

Add to your MCP settings file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "muninndb": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

MuninnDB exposes **17 MCP tools** — store, activate, search, watch, manage vaults, and more. No token required against the default vault. [Full MCP reference →](https://muninndb.com/docs)

## What Just Happened

Most databases store data and wait. MuninnDB stores *memory traces* — called **engrams** — and continuously works on them in the background. When you called `activate`, it ran a 6-phase pipeline: parallel full-text + vector search, fused the results, applied Hebbian co-activation boosts from past queries, traversed the association graph, and scored everything by confidence — in under 20ms.

The Q3 incident surfaced because MuninnDB understood that *"payment retry logic"* and *"idempotency keys after a double-charge"* are part of the same conversation. You never wrote that relationship. It emerged from semantic proximity and how these concepts travel together. That is the difference between a database and memory.

## Why MuninnDB

- **Memory decay** — relevance recalculates continuously using the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. Old memories fade. Frequently recalled memories stay sharp. The database moves while you sleep.
- **Hebbian learning** — memories activated together automatically form associations. Edges strengthen with co-activation, fade when the pattern stops. You never define a schema of relationships.
- **Semantic triggers** — subscribe to a context. The database pushes when something becomes relevant — not because you queried, but because *relevance changed*. No polling. No cron. The DB initiates.
- **Bayesian confidence** — every engram tracks how sure MuninnDB is. Reinforcing memories raise confidence; contradictions lower it. Grounded in evidence, not a label you assign.
- **Retroactive enrichment** — add the embed or enrich plugin and every existing memory upgrades automatically in the background. No migration. No code change. The database improves what it already holds.
- **Four protocols** — MBP (binary, <10ms ACK), REST (JSON), gRPC (protobuf), MCP (AI agents). Pick your stack; they all hit the same cognitive engine.
- **Single binary** — no Redis, no Kafka, no Postgres dependency. One process. One install command. Runs on a MacBook or a 3-node cluster.

## Examples

**REST — the full cycle:**

```bash
# Write
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8475/api/engrams \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "concept": "auth architecture",
    "content": "Short-lived JWTs (15min), refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies, sessions server-side in Redis",
    "tags": ["auth", "security"]
  }'

# Activate by context (returns ranked, decayed, associated memories)
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8475/api/activate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"context": ["reviewing the login flow for the mobile app"], "max_results": 5}'

# Search by text
curl 'http://localhost:8475/api/engrams?q=JWT&vault=default'
```

**Python SDK:**

```python
from muninn import MuninnClient

async with MuninnClient("http://localhost:8475") as m:
    # Store
    await m.write(vault="default", concept="auth architecture",
                  content="Short-lived JWTs, refresh in HttpOnly cookies")

    # Activate — context-aware, ranked, cognitively weighted
    result = await m.activate(vault="default",
                              context=["reviewing the login flow"],
                              max_results=5)
    for item in result.activations:
        print(f"{item.concept}  score={item.score:.3f}")
```

```bash
pip install muninn-python
```

**LangChain integration:**

```python
from muninn.langchain import MuninnDBMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

memory = MuninnDBMemory(vault="my-agent")
chain = ConversationChain(llm=your_llm, memory=memory)
# Every turn is stored. Every response draws on relevant past context.
```

## Configuration

MuninnDB works out of the box with no configuration. The bundled local embedder is included — offline, no API key, no setup.

When you're ready to customize:

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Embedder: bundled (default) | On automatically — set `MUNINN_LOCAL_EMBED=0` to disable |
| Embedder: Ollama | `MUNINN_OLLAMA_URL=ollama://localhost:11434/nomic-embed-text` |
| Embedder: OpenAI | `MUNINN_OPENAI_KEY=sk-...` |
| Embedder: Voyage | `MUNINN_VOYAGE_KEY=pa-...` |
| LLM enrichment | `MUNINN_ENRICH_URL=anthropic://claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` + `MUNINN_ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-ant-...` |
| Data directory | `MUNINNDB_DATA=/path/to/data` (default: `~/.muninn/data`) |
| Memory limit | `MUNINN_MEM_LIMIT_GB=4` |

**Docker:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name muninndb \
  -p 8474:8474 -p 8475:8475 -p 8476:8476 -p 8750:8750 \
  -v muninndb-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/scrypster/muninndb:latest
```
